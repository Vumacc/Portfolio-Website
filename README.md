# Description
This is a repository containing my official portfolio websites source code.\
It is still very much still in development as well.

**Note:** The `.replit` files exist since I'm using [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) for temporary deployment for my website

### Currently planning on doing
- The projects page
- The contacts page
- A couple projects on the homepage (IN DEVELOPMENT)
